            We started this platform with a simple, honest problem: medicines are confusing and for many, uncomfortable, intimidating, or even unpleasant to take.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Like many others, I have struggled with taking medicines, not just because of taste or texture, but because of the uncertainty around them. What exactly am I putting into my body? Why this medicine and not another? What should I expect?
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Existing resources often answer these questions, but in language that feels clinical, dense, and inaccessible. This website was built to change that. We simplify medicine information so that it's clear, practical, and actually useful in everyday life. No unnecessary jargon. No overwhelming walls of text. Just straightforward explanations about what a medicine does, when to take it, what to watch out for, and how it might feel.

              This platform is also shaped by a background in public health and research. With experience in epidemiology, nutrition, and health systems, we understand both the science behind medicines and the importance of communicating that science in a way people can truly understand.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              We believe that access to information is not enough, it has to be accessible. Our goal is not to replace doctors or pharmacists, but to empower you to feel more informed, less anxious, and more in control of your health decisions.
